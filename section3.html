        <h1>Sharks</h1>
        <p>Sharks are a group of elasmobranch fish characterized by a cartilaginous skeleton, five to seven gill slits on the sides of the head, and pectoral fins that are not fused to the head.</p>
        <img src="img/shark.jpg" alt="Shark Image">
        <p>They are found in all seas and are common to depths of 2,000 meters (6,600 ft). They generally do not live in freshwater, with a few exceptions such as the bull shark and the river shark. Sharks are a critical part of marine ecosystems and are often apex predators in their environments.</p>
